Tolling.Network is a distributed ledger solution powered by a blockchain for tolling interoperability. It solves the big problems inherent in hub-based interoperability: sharing huge data files every day, wrangling business rules within a consortium, and knowing—with certainty—the history of every transaction and status update.

Focused on transparency and auditability, it provides a flexible and scalable cloud-based alternative for sharing agency-to-agency data. By giving toll agencies a single integration point for peer-to-peer interoperability, Tolling.Network extends collaboration, enhances data security, and greatly improves operational efficiency.

Tolling.Network is built on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source, enterprise-level blockchain platform that does not use cryptocurrency. The modular architecture “allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play.” Tolling.Network’s simple integration makes it easy to implement and manage.
